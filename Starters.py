"Truths and numbers (use function 'print()')"

"-----------------------------------------------"

"Print your name"

"Make a comment like this"

"Use # to make a comment"

"Print the sum of two numbers"

"Modulo of 4 and 2? (Hint: 4 modulo 2 = 4-2-2 = 0)"

"Is 5 greater than 2? Use '>' and print it"

"Is the sum of 5 and 5 equal to 11?"

"5 is greater-or-equal than 5? (Hint: use >=)"




"Variables (when printing don't use any written numbers, use only variable values, so don't do like 
"print("There are 100 people at the zoo"))"

"-----------------------------------------------"

"Make variable 'people' and set its value to 100"

"print the value so the outcome is 'There are 100 people at the zoo'"

"make a new value and name it 'got-eaten' and set its value to 25"

"print 'But 25 of them got eaten by a monkey', but use only variables not '25' as written number"

"print 'Now there are 75 people left and that is 75% from the original'."


"To be continued..."
