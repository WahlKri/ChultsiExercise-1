"What happened and why?"


"To get input use the following function: 'input()', you can test it out by writing print(input())"
"You can also do name = input(). Test it out and write what it does"

"Next make a program that asks name, age and birthplace from the user. Save inputs to variables and print them out"

"Make a calculator which asks for a two integers and plusses them together. For example "
#Give number a: 
#Give number b: 
#The sum of a and b is result

"Did you encounter any problems? Remember that input() produces raw data format/string. You must somehow turn that "
"into integer. For example '(float) variable = 5', turns 5 into decimal 5.0. That is called casting"

"What happens if you try input(5). Why this happens?"

"Difference between %s and %r?"

"What happens when you write input(), PyCharm gives more info about the function and it should say print(prompt),"
"What do you think prompt means and how it could be used. Hint: input(\"Give a number\")"
"Use the new way of writing a program that asks for a name, age and birthplace. It should also print the results out"

"Read chapter 14 and answer to these questions."
"What does import do? How about from?"
"Try to import 'getsizeof' from sys and use it"

"import argv from sys. And make a variable called 'path' and set its value to argv[0]. Then print the variable 'path'"
"What happened?"


"Make a program that works following way. You can use any structure you want, but the main idea is to ask "
"couple of questions from the user and print them out"

"""
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
What is your name?
> Kalle (user input)
Do you like me Kalle?
>  Yes (user input)
Where do you live Kalle?
>  San Francisco (user input)
What kind of computer do you have?
>  Tandy 1000 (user input)

Alright, so you said 'Yes' about liking me.
You live in 'San Francisco'.  Not sure where that is.
And you have a 'Tandy 1000' computer.  Nice.
