"READING FILES"

"""Reading files with Python is actually really easy. First we need to introduce yet a new function : open()

   For this exercise there is a .txt-file named 'exampleText.txt'. Open it in pyCharm and try to use open()-
   function to print its content. 
   
   1. Make a new variable.
   2. Assing the function open(filename) to that variable.
   3. Now write yourVariable and a dot. See what different functions you can use for opened file.
   4. Find at least how to see if a opened file is writable/readable, how to get the name of the file and
      the most important function read(). 
   5. Use those functions to print out the following:
   
    Name of the file: exampleText.txt
    Writable: False
    Readable: True
    
    Contents: 
    This is stuff I typed into a file.
    It is really cool stuff.
    Lots and lots of fun to have in here.
      
   6. Now do the same exercise, but use input from the user. The output should be something like this:
   
    Give filename: exampleText.txt (user input)
    
    Name of the file: exampleText.txt
    Writable: False
    Readable: True
    
    Contents: 
    This is stuff I typed into a file.
    It is really cool stuff.
    Lots and lots of fun to have in here.
      
   7. Find out answer for these next questions: 
  
      * Does txt = open(filename) return the contents of the file?
      * What does from sys import argv mean?
      * Why is there no error when we open the file twice?
